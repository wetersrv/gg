If your render distance is LESS than 14, the map WILL NOT WORK! 
(Because command blocks will not load and nothing will happen, e.g. you click start) 

- Play on optifine 1.16.5! (Important for 3D models, custom mobs, etc.)
- Don't use F5! (this will broke the map!)
- Turn OFF ALL YOUR: Custom mods, Resorce Pack, Texture Packs, etc.
